Installing Elvish with a package manager allows you to upgrade Elvish alongside
the rest of your system, but may not give you the latest version.

If the package manager you use doesn't have the latest version, you are strongly
recommended to the [official binary](./) instead. For a comprehensive list of
packages and their freshness, see
[this Repology page](https://repology.org/project/elvish/versions).

# Etymology

In [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), items made by the
elves have a reputation of high quality. These are usually called _elven_ items,
but "elvish" was chosen because it ends with "sh", a long tradition of Unix
shells. It also rhymes with [fish](https://fishshell.com), one of the shells
that influenced the philosophy of Elvish.

# Stylization

The word "Elvish" should be capitalized like a proper noun. However, when
referring to the `elvish` command, use it in lower case with fixed-width font
(like in this sentence).

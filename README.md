Elvish is a friendly interactive shell and an expressive programming language.
It runs on Linux, BSDs, macOS and Windows. Despite its pre-1.0 status, it is
already suitable for most daily interactive use.

Most of the resources for Elvish can be found on the [official website](https://elv.sh).

## Building Elvish

To build Elvish, you need

*   Linux, {Free,Net,Open}BSD, macOS, or Windows (Windows support is experimental).

*   Go >= 1.12.

If you have not done so, first set up your environment by following [How To Write Go Code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).

There are two ways to build Elvish. You can build it directly with `go get`:

```sh
go get github.com/elves/elvish
```

However, binaries built in this way lacks some build-time information; for instance, `elvish -version` will show `unknown`. To add such information, use `make`:

```sh
cd `go env GOPATH`/src/github.com/elves/elvish
make get
```

In either cases, the binary is placed in `$GOPATH/bin`. Consider adding it to your `$PATH` if you want to run the Elvish binary you just built by just typing `elvish`.

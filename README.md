Elvish is a friendly interactive shell and an expressive programming language.
It runs on Linux, BSDs, macOS and Windows. Despite its pre-1.0 status, it is
already suitable for most daily interactive use.

## Building Elvish

Most users can just use [prebuilt binaries](https://elv.sh/get/) and do not need
to build from source.

To build Elvish from source, you need

-   A supported OS: Linux, {Free,Net,Open}BSD, macOS, or Windows.

    **NOTE**: Windows support is experimental, and only Windows 10 is supported.

-   Go >= 1.13.

To build Elvish from source, follow these steps:

```sh
# 1. Start from any directory you want to store Elvish's source code
# 2. Clone the Git repository
git clone https://github.com/elves/elvish
# 3. Change into the repository
cd elvish
# 4. Build and install Elvish
make get
```

This will install Elvish to `~/go/bin`.

Alternatively, you can also just use `go get` to install Elvish:

```sh
go get -u github.com/elves/elvish
```

This will clone the Git repository to `~/go/src/github.com/elves/elvish`,
updating it if already exists, and install Elvish to `~/go/bin`. However, Elvish
built this way will lack version information, although it is otherwise fully
functional.

Some tips on installation:

-   Remember to add `$HOME/go/bin` to your `PATH` so that you can run `elvish`
    directly.

-   If you want to install Elvish to a different place, follow
    [these steps](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) to set
    `GOPATH`, and Elvish will be installed to `$GOPATH/bin` instead.

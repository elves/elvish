      <h2>Powerful Pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        Text pipelines are intuitive and powerful. However, if your data have
        inherently complex structures, processing them with the pipeline
        often requires a lot of ad-hoc, hard-to-maintain text processing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pipelines in Elvish can carry structured data, not just text. You can
        stream lists, maps and even functions through the pipeline.

      <h2>Intuitive Control Structures</h2>
      <p>
        If you know programming, you probably already know how
        <code>if</code> looks in C. So why learn another syntax?
      </p>
      <p>
        Elvish comes with a standard set of control structures: conditional
        control with <code>if</code>, loops with <code>for</code> and
        <code>while</code>, and exception handling with <code>try</code>. All
        of them have a familiar C-like syntax.

      <h2>Directory History</h2>
      <p>
        Do you type far too many <code>cd</code> commands? Do you struggle to
        remember which <code>deeply/nested/directory</code> your source codes,
        logs and configuration files are?
      </p>
      <p>
        Backed by a real database, Elvish remembers all the directories you
        have been to, all the time. Just press <span class="key">Ctrl-L</span>
        and search, as you do in a browser.

      <h2>Command History</h2>
      <p>
        Want to find the magical <code>ffmpeg</code> command that you used to
        transcode a video file two months ago, but it's buried under a
        million other commands?
      </p>
      <p>
        No more cycling through history one command at a time.
        Press <span class="key">Ctrl-R</span> and start searching your entire
        command history.

        Want the convenience of a file manager, but can't give up the power of
        a shell?
      </p>
      <p>
        You no longer have to make a choice. Press <span
        class="key">Ctrl-N</span> to start exploring directories and
        preview files, with the full power of a shell still under your
        fingertip.

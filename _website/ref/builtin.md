# Introduction

The builtin module contains facilities that are potentially useful to all
users. It occupies the `builtin:` namespace. You rarely have to explicitly
specify the namespace though, since it is one of the namespaces consulted when
resolving unqualified names.

## Usage Notation

The usage of a builtin command is described by giving an example usage, using
variables as arguments. For instance, The `repeat` command takes two arguments
and are described as:

```elvish
repeat $n $v
```

Optional arguments are represented with a trailing `?`, while variadic
arguments with a trailing `...`. For instance, the `count` command takes an optional list:

```elvish
count $input-list?
```

While the `put` command takes an arbitrary number of arguments:

```elvish
put $values...
```

Options are given along with their default values. For instance, the `echo`
command takes an `sep` option and arbitrary arguments:

```elvish
echo &sep=' ' $value...
```

(When you calling functions, options are always optional.)


## Supplying Input

Some builtin functions, e.g. `count` and `each`, can take their input in one
of two ways:

1. From pipe:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> put lorem ipsum | count # count number of inputs
    2
    ~> put 10 100 | each [x]{ + 1 $x } # apply function to each input
    ▶ 11
    ▶ 101
    ```

    Byte pipes are also possible; one line becomes one input:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> echo "a\nb\nc" | count # count number of lines
    ▶ 3
    ```

1. From an argument -- an iterable value:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> count [lorem ipsum] # count number of elements in argument
    2
    ~> each [x]{ + 1 $x } [10 100] # apply to each element in argument
    ▶ 11
    ▶ 101
    ```

    Strings, and in future, other sequence types are also possible:

    ```elvish-transcript
    ~> count lorem
    ▶ 5
    ```

When documenting such commands, the optional argument is always written as
`$input-list?`. On the other hand, a trailing `$input-list?` always indicates
that a command can take its input in one of two ways above: this fact is not
repeated below.

**Note**: You should prefer the first form, unless using it requires explicit
`put` commands. Avoid `count [(some-command)]` or `each $some-func
[(some-command)]`; they are, most of the time, equivalent to `some-command |
count` or `some-command | each $some-func`.

**Rationale**: An alternative way to design this is to make (say) `count` take
an arbitrary number of arguments, and count its arguments; when there is 0
argument, count inputs. However, this leads to problems in code like `count
*`; the intention is clearly to count the number of files in the current
directory, but when the current directory is empty, `count` will wait for
inputs. Hence it is required to put the input in a list: `count [*]`
unambiguously supplies input in the argument, even if there is no file.

## Numerical Commands

Commands that operate on numbers are quite flexible about the format of the
numbers. Integers can be specified as decimals (e.g. `233`) or hexadecimals
(e.g. `0xE9`) and floating-point numbers can be specified using the scientific
notation (e.g. `2.33e2`). These are different strings, but equal when
considered as commands.

Elvish has no special syntax or data type for numbers. Instead, they are just
strings. For this reason, builtin commands for strings and numbers are
completely separate. For instance, the numerical equality command is `==`,
while the string equality command is `==s`. Another example is the `+`
builtin, which only operates on numbers and does not function as a string
concatenation commands.


## Predicates

Predicates are functions that write exactly one output that is either `$true`
or `$false`. They are described like "Determine ..." or "Test ...". See
[`is`](#is) for one example.


## "Do Not Use" Functions and Variables

The name of some variables and functions have a leading `-`. This is a
convention to say that it is subject to change and should not be depended
upon. They are either only useful for debug purposes, or have known issues in
the interface or implementation, and in the worst case will make Elvish crash.
(Before 1.0, all features are subject to change, but those ones are sure to be
changed.)

Those functions and variables are documented near the end of the respective
sections. Their known problem is also discussed.


# Builtin Functions

## + - * /

```elvish
+ $summand...
- $minuend $subtrahend...
* $factor...
/ $dividend $divisor...
```

Basic arithmetic operations of adding, subtraction, multiplication and
division respectively.

All of them can take multiple arguments:

```elvish-transcript
~> + 2 5 7 # 2 + 5 + 7
▶ 14
~> - 2 5 7 # 2 - 5 - 7
▶ -10
~> * 2 5 7 # 2 * 5 * 7
▶ 70
~> / 2 5 7 # 2 / 5 / 7
▶ 0.05714285714285715
```

When given one element, they all output their sole argument (given that it
is a valid number). When given no argument,

*   `+` outputs 0, and `*` outputs 1. You can think that they both have
    a "hidden" argument of 0 or 1, which does not alter their behaviors (in
    mathematical terms, 0 and 1 are [identity
    elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element) of addition and
    multiplication, respectively).

*   `-` throws an exception.

*   `/` becomes a synonym for `cd /`, due to the implicit cd feature. (The
    implicit cd feature will probably change to avoid this oddity).

## %

```elvish
% $dividend $divisor
```

Output the remainder after dividing `$dividend` by `$divisor`. Both must be
integers. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> % 23 7
▶ 2
```

## ^

```elvish
^ $base $exponent
```

Output the result of raising `$base` to the power of `$exponent`. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> ^ 2 10
▶ 1024
~> ^ 2 0.5
▶ 1.4142135623730951
```

## &lt; &lt;= == != &gt; &gt;=

```elvish
<  $number... # less
<= $number... # less or equal
== $number... # equal
!= $number... # not equal
>  $number... # greater
>= $number... # greater or equal
```

Number comparisons. All of them accept an arbitrary number of arguments:

1.  When given fewer than two arguments, all output `$true`.

2.  When given two arguments, output whether the two arguments satisfy the
    named relationship.

3.  When given more than two arguments, output whether every adjacent pair of
    numbers satisfy the named relationship.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> == 3 3.0
▶ $true
~> < 3 4
▶ $true
~> < 3 4 10
▶ $true
~> < 6 9 1
▶ $false
```

As a consequence of rule 3, the `!=` command outputs `$true` as long as any
*adjacent* pair of numbers are not equal, even if some numbers that are not
adjacent are equal:

```elvish-transcript
~> != 5 5 4
▶ $false
~> != 5 6 5
▶ $true
```


## &lt;s &lt;=s ==s !=s &gt;s &gt;=s

```elvish
<s  $string... # less
<=s $string... # less or equal
==s $string... # equal
!=s $string... # not equal
>s  $string... # greater
>=s $string... # greater or equal
```

String comparisons. They behave similarly to their number counterparts when
given multiple arguments. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> >s lorem ipsum
▶ $true
~> ==s 1 1.0
▶ $false
~> >s 8 12
▶ $true
```


## all

```elvish
all
```

Pass inputs, both bytes and values, to the output.

This is an identity function in pipelines: `a | all | b` is equivalent to `a |
b`. It is mainly useful for turning inputs into arguments, like:

```elvish-transcript
~> put 'lorem,ipsum' | splits , (all)
▶ lorem
▶ ipsum
```

Or capturing all inputs in a variable:

```elvish-transcript
~> x = [(all)]
foo
bar
(Press ^D)
~> put $x
▶ [foo bar]
```


## assoc

```elvish
assoc $container $k $v
```

Output a slightly modified version of `$container`, such that its value at `$k`
is `$v`. Applies to both lists and to maps.

When `$container` is a list, `$k` may be a negative index. However, slice is
not yet supported.


```elvish-transcript
~> assoc [foo bar quux] 0 lorem
▶ [lorem bar quux]
~> assoc [foo bar quux] -1 ipsum
▶ [foo bar ipsum]
~> assoc [&k=v] k v2
▶ [&k=v2]
~> assoc [&k=v] k2 v2
▶ [&k2=v2 &k=v]
```

Etymology: [Clojure](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/assoc).

$cf dissoc


## bool

```elvish
bool $value
```

Convert a value to boolean. In Elvish, only `$false` and errors are booleanly
false. Everything else, including 0, empty strings and empty lists, is
booleanly true:

```elvish-transcript
~> bool $true
▶ $true
~> bool $false
▶ $false
~> bool $ok
▶ $true
~> bool ?(fail haha)
▶ $false
~> bool ''
▶ $true
~> bool []
▶ $true
~> bool abc
▶ $true
```

$cf not

## cd

```elvish
cd $dirname
```

Change directory.

Note that Elvish's `cd` does not support `cd -`.


## chr

```elvish
chr $number...
```

Outputs a string consisting of the given Unicode codepoints. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> chr 0x61
▶ a
~> chr 0x4f60 0x597d
▶ 你好
```

Etymology: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr).

$cf ord


## constantly

```elvish
constantly $value...
```

Output a function that takes no arguments and outputs `$value`s when called.
Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> f=(constantly lorem ipsum)
~> $f
▶ lorem
▶ ipsum
```

The above example is actually equivalent to simply `f = []{ put lorem ipsum }`;
it is most useful when the argument is **not** a literal value, e.g.

```elvish-transcript
~> f = (constantly (uname))
~> $f
▶ Darwin
~> $f
▶ Darwin
```

The above code only calls `uname` once, while if you do `f = []{ put (uname) }`,
every time you invoke `$f`, `uname` will be called.

Etymology: [Clojure](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/constantly).


## count

```elvish
count $input-list?
```

Count the number of inputs.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> count lorem # count bytes in a string
▶ 5
~> count [lorem ipsum]
▶ 2
~> range 100 | count
▶ 100
~> seq 100 | count
▶ 100
```


## dir-history

```elvish
dir-history
```

Return a list containing the directory history. Each element is a map
with two keys: `path` and `score`. The list is sorted by descending
score.

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> dir-history | take 1
▶ [&path=/Users/foo/.elvish &score=96.79928]
```

## dissoc

```elvish
dissoc $map $k
```

Output a slightly modified version of `$map`, with the key `$k` removed. If
`$map` does not contain `$k` as a key, the same map is returned.

```elvish-transcript
~> dissoc [&foo=bar &lorem=ipsum] foo
▶ [&lorem=ipsum]
~> dissoc [&foo=bar &lorem=ipsum] k
▶ [&lorem=ipsum &foo=bar]
```

$cf assoc

## drop

```elvish
drop $n $input-list?
```

Drop the first `$n` elements of the input. If `$n` is larger than the number of
input elements, the entire input is dropped.

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> drop 2 [a b c d e]
▶ c
▶ d
▶ e
~> splits ' ' 'how are you?' | drop 1
▶ are
▶ 'you?'
~> range 2 | drop 10
```

Etymology: Haskell.

$cf take


## each

```elvish
each $f $input-list?
```

Call `$f` on all inputs. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> range 5 8 | each [x]{ ^ $x 2 }
▶ 25
▶ 36
▶ 49
~> each [x]{ put $x[:3] } [lorem ipsum]
▶ lor
▶ ips
```

$cf peach

Etymology: Various languages, as `for each`. Happens to have the same name as
the iteration construct of
[Factor](http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-each,sequences.html).


## eawk

```elvish
eawk $f $input-list?
```

For each input, call `$f` with the input followed by all its fields.

It should behave the same as the following functions:

```elvish
fn eawk [f @rest]{
  each [line]{
    @fields = (re:split '[ \t]+'
                        (re:replace '^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$' '' $line))
    $f $line $@fields
  } $@rest
}
```

This command allows you to write code very similar to `awk` scripts using
anonymous functions. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo ' lorem ipsum
   1 2' | awk '{ print $1 }'
lorem
1
~> echo ' lorem ipsum
   1 2' | eawk [line a b]{ put $a }
▶ lorem
▶ 1
```


## echo

```elvish
echo &sep=' ' $value...
```

Print all arguments, joined by the `sep` option, and followed by a newline.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo Hello   elvish
Hello elvish
~> echo "Hello   elvish"
Hello   elvish
~> echo &sep=, lorem ipsum
lorem,ipsum
```

Notes: The `echo` builtin does not treat `-e` or `-n` specially. For instance,
`echo -n` just prints `-n`. Use double-quoted strings to print special
characters, and `print` to suppress the trailing newline.

$cf print

Etymology: Bourne sh.


## eq

```elvish
eq $values...
```

Determine whether all `$value`s are structurally equivalent. Writes `$true`
when given no or one argument.

```elvish-transcript
~> eq a a
▶ $true
~> eq [a] [a]
▶ $true
~> eq [&k=v] [&k=v]
▶ $true
~> eq a [b]
▶ $false
```

$cf is not-eq

Etymology: [Perl](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Equality-Operators).


## exec

```elvish
exec $command?
```

Replace the Elvish process with an external `$command`, defaulting to
`elvish`.


## exit

```elvish
exit $status?
```

Exit the Elvish process with `$status` (defaulting to 0).

## explode

```elvish
explode $iterable
```

Put all elements of `$iterable` on the structured stdout. Like `flatten` in
functional languages. Equivalent to `[li]{ put $@li }`.

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> explode [a b [x]]
▶ a
▶ b
▶ [x]
```

Etymology: [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php). PHP's
`explode` is actually equivalent to Elvish's `splits`, but the author liked
the name too much to not use it.


## external

```elvish
external $program
```

Construct a callable value for the external program `$program`. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> x = (external man)
~> $x ls # opens the manpage for ls
```

$cf has-external search-external

## fail

```elvish
fail $message
```

Throw an exception.

```elvish-transcript
~> fail bad
Exception: bad
Traceback:
  [interactive], line 1:
    fail bad
~> put ?(fail bad)
▶ ?(fail bad)
```

**Note**: Exceptions are now only allowed to carry string messages. You cannot
do `fail [&cause=xxx]` (this will, ironically, throw a different exception
complaining that you cannot throw a map). This is subject to change. Builtins
will likely also throw structured exceptions in future.


## fclose

```elvish
fclose $file
```

Close a file opened with `fopen`.

$cf fopen


## fopen

```elvish
fopen $filename
```

Open a file. Currently, `fopen` only supports opening a file for reading. File
must be closed with `fclose` explicitly. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> cat a.txt
This is
a file.
~> f = (fopen a.txt)
~> cat < $f
This is
a file.
~> fclose $f
```

$cf fclose


## from-json

```elvish
from-json
```

Takes bytes stdin, parses it as JSON and puts the result on structured stdout.
The input can contain multiple JSONs, which can, but do not have to, be
separated with whitespaces.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo '"a"' | from-json
▶ a
~> echo '["lorem", "ipsum"]' | from-json
▶ [lorem ipsum]
~> echo '{"lorem": "ipsum"}' | from-json
▶ [&lorem=ipsum]
~> # multiple JSONs running together
   echo '"a""b"["x"]' | from-json
▶ a
▶ b
▶ [x]
~> # multiple JSONs separated by newlines
   echo '"a"
   {"k": "v"}' | from-json
▶ a
▶ [&k=v]
```

$cf to-json


## get-env

```elvish
get-env $name
```

Gets the value of an environment variable. Throws an exception if the
environment variable does not exist. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> get-env LANG
▶ zh_CN.UTF-8
~> get-env NO_SUCH_ENV
Exception: non-existent environment variable
[tty], line 1: get-env NO_SUCH_ENV
```

$cf has-env set-env unset-env


## has-env

```elvish
has-env $name
```

Test whether an environment variable exists. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> has-env PATH
▶ $true
~> has-env NO_SUCH_ENV
▶ $false
```

$cf get-env set-env unset-env


## has-external

```elvish
has-external $command
```

Test whether `$command` names a valid external command. Examples (your output
might differ):

```elvish-transcript
~> has-external cat
▶ $true
~> has-external lalala
▶ $false
```

$cf external search-external


## has-prefix

```elvish
has-prefix $string $prefix
```

Determine whether `$prefix` is a prefix of `$string`. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> has-prefix lorem,ipsum lor
▶ $true
~> has-prefix lorem,ipsum foo
▶ $false
```

## has-suffix

```elvish
has-suffix $string $suffix
```

Determine whether `$suffix` is a suffix of `$string`. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> has-suffix a.html .txt
▶ $false
~> has-suffix a.html .html
▶ $true
```


## is

```elvish
is $values...
```

Determine whether all `$value`s have the same identity. Writes `$true` when
given no or one argument.

The definition of identity is subject to change. Do not rely on its behavior.

```elvish-transcript
~> is a a
▶ $true
~> is a b
▶ $false
~> is [] []
▶ $true
~> is [a] [a]
▶ $false
```

$cf eq

Etymology: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is).


## joins

```elvish
joins $sep $input-list?
```

Join inputs with `$sep`. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> put lorem ipsum | joins ,
▶ lorem,ipsum
~> joins , [lorem ipsum]
▶ lorem,ipsum
```

The suffix "s" means "string" and also serves to avoid colliding with the
well-known [join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/join_(Unix)) utility.

Etymology: Various languages as `join`, in particular
[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.join).

$cf splits


## keys

```elvish
keys $map
```

Put all keys of `$map` on the structured stdout.

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> keys [&a=foo &b=bar &c=baz]
▶ a
▶ c
▶ b
```

Note that there is no guaranteed order for the keys of a map.


## kind-of

```elvish
kind-of $value...
```

Output the kinds of `$value`s. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> kind-of lorem [] [&]
▶ string
▶ list
▶ map
```

The terminology and definition of "kind" is subject to change.

## nop

```elvish
nop &any-opt= $value...
```

Accepts arbitrary arguments and options and does exactly nothing.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> nop
~> nop a b c
~> nop &k=v
```

Etymology: Various languages, in particular NOP in [assembly
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP).


## not

```elvish
not $value
```

Boolean negation. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> not $true
▶ $false
~> not $false
▶ $true
~> not $ok
▶ $false
~> not ?(fail error)
▶ $true
```

**NOTE**: `and` and `or` are implemented as special commands.

$cf bool


## not-eq

```elvish
not-eq $values...
```

Determines whether every adjacent pair of `$value`s are not equal. Note that
this does not imply that `$value`s are all distinct. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> not-eq 1 2 3
▶ $true
~> not-eq 1 2 1
▶ $true
~> not-eq 1 1 2
▶ $false
```

$cf eq


## ord

```elvish
ord $string
```

Output value of each codepoint in `$string`, in hexadecimal. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> ord a
▶ 0x61
~> ord 你好
▶ 0x4f60
▶ 0x597d
```

The output format is subject to change.

Etymology: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord).

$cf chr


## path-*

```elvish
path-abs $path
path-base $path
path-clean $path
path-dir $path
path-ext $path
```

See [godoc of path/filepath](https://godoc.org/path/filepath). Go errors are
turned into exceptions.

## peach

```elvish
peach $f $input-list?
```

Call `$f` on all inputs, possibly in parallel.

Example (your output will differ):

```elvish-transcript
~> range 1 7 | peach [x]{ + $x 10 }
▶ 12
▶ 11
▶ 13
▶ 16
▶ 15
▶ 14
```

This command is intended for homogeneous processing of possibly unbound data.
If you need to do a fixed number of heterogeneous things in parallel, use
`run-parallel`.

$cf each run-parallel


## pipe

```elvish
pipe
```

Create a new Unix pipe that can be used in redirections.

A pipe contains both the read FD and the write FD. When redirecting command
input to a pipe with `<`, the read FD is used. When redirecting command output
to a pipe with `>`, the write FD is used. It is not supported to redirect both
input and output with `<>` to a pipe.

Pipes have an OS-dependent buffer, so writing to a pipe without an active
reader does not necessarily block. Pipes **must** be explicitly closed with
`prclose` and `pwclose`.

Putting values into pipes will cause those values to be discarded.

Examples (assuming the pipe has a large enough buffer):

```elvish-transcript
~> p = (pipe)
~> echo 'lorem ipsum' > $p
~> head -n1 < $p
lorem ipsum
~> put 'lorem ipsum' > $p
~> head -n1 < $p
# blocks
# $p should be closed with prclose and pwclose afterwards
```

$cf prclose pwclose


## prclose

```elvish
prclose $pipe
```

Close the read end of a pipe.

$cf pwclose pipe


## put

```elvish
put $value...
```

Takes arbitrary arguments and write them to the structured stdout.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> put a
▶ a
~> put lorem ipsum [a b] { ls }
▶ lorem
▶ ipsum
▶ [a b]
▶ <closure 0xc4202607e0>
```

Etymology: Various languages, in particular
[C](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/manpages-dev/puts.3.en.html) and [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/IO.html#method-i-puts) as `puts`.


## pprint

```elvish
pprint $value...
```

Pretty-print representations of Elvish values. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> pprint [foo bar]
[
 foo
 bar
]
~> pprint [&k1=v1 &k2=v2]
[
 &k2=
  v2
 &k1=
  v1
]
```

The output format is subject to change.

$cf repr

## print

```elvish
print &sep=' ' $value...
```

Like `echo`, just without the newline.

$cf echo

Etymology: Various languages, in particular
[Perl](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/print.html) and
[zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html),
whose `print`s do not print a trailing newline.


## pwclose

```elvish
pwclose $pipe
```

Close the write end of a pipe.

$cf prclose pipe


## range

```elvish
range &step=1 $low? $high
```

Output `$low`, `$low` + `$step`, ..., proceeding as long as smaller than
`$high`. If not given, `$low` defaults to 0.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> range 4
▶ 0
▶ 1
▶ 2
▶ 3
~> range 1 6 &step=2
▶ 1
▶ 3
▶ 5
```

Beware floating point oddities:

```elvish-transcript
~> range 0 0.8 &step=.1
▶ 0
▶ 0.1
▶ 0.2
▶ 0.30000000000000004
▶ 0.4
▶ 0.5
▶ 0.6
▶ 0.7
▶ 0.7999999999999999
```

Etymology:
[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range).


## rand

```elvish
rand
```

Output a pseudo-random number in the interval [0, 1). Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> rand
▶ 0.17843564133528436
```

## randint

```elvish
randint $low $high
```

Output a pseudo-random integer in the interval [$low, $high). Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> # Emulate dice
   randint 1 7
▶ 6
```


## repeat

```elvish
repeat $n $value
```

Output `$value` for `$n` times. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> repeat 0 lorem
~> repeat 4 NAN
▶ NAN
▶ NAN
▶ NAN
▶ NAN
```

Etymology: [Clojure](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/repeat).

## replaces

```elvish
replaces &max=-1 $old $repl $source
```

Replace all occurrences of `$old` with `$repl` in `$source`. If `$max` is
non-negative, it determines the max number of substitutions.

**Note**: `replaces` does not support searching by regular
expressions, `$old` is always interpreted as a plain string. Use
[re:replace](re.html#replace) if you need to search by regex.

## repr

```elvish
repr $value...
```

Writes representation of `$value`s, separated by space and followed by a
newline. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> repr [foo 'lorem ipsum'] "aha\n"
[foo 'lorem ipsum'] "aha\n"
```

$cf pprint

Etymology: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr).


## resolve

```elvish
resolve $command
```

Resolve `$command`. Command resolution is described in the [language
reference](language.html). (TODO: actually describe it there.)

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> resolve echo
▶ <builtin echo>
~> fn f { }
~> resolve f
▶ <closure 0xc4201c24d0>
~> resolve cat
▶ <external cat>
```


## run-parallel

```elvish
run-parallel $callable ...
```

Run several callables in parallel, and wait for all of them to finish.

If one or more callables throw exceptions, the other callables continue
running, and a composite exception is thrown when all callables finish
execution.

The behavior of `run-parallel` is consistent with the behavior of pipelines,
except that it does not perform any redirections.

Here is an example that lets you pipe the stdout and stderr of a command to
two different commands:

```elvish
pout = (pipe)
perr = (pipe)
run-parallel {
  foo > $pout 2> $perr
  pwclose $pout
  pwclose $perr
} {
  bar < $pout
  prclose $pout
} {
  bar2 < $perr
  prclose $perr
}
```

This command is intended for doing a fixed number of heterogeneous things in
parallel. If you need homogeneous parallel processing of possibly unbound data,
use `peach` instead.

$cf peach


## search-external

```elvish
search-external $command
```

Output the full path of the external `$command`. Throws an exception when not
found. Example (your output might vary):

```elvish-transcript
~> search-external cat
▶ /bin/cat
```

$cf external has-external


## set-env

```elvish
set-env $name $value
```

Sets an environment variable to the given value. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> set-env X foobar
~> put $E:X
▶ foobar
```

$cf get-env has-env unset-env


## slurp

```elvish
slurp
```

Reads bytes input into a single string, and put this string on structured
stdout.

Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo "a\nb" | slurp
▶ "a\nb\n"
```

Etymology: Perl, as
[`File::Slurp`](http://search.cpan.org/~uri/File-Slurp-9999.19/lib/File/Slurp.pm).


## splits

```elvish
splits $sep $string
```

Split `$string` by `$sep`. If `$sep` is an empty string, split it into
codepoints.

```elvish-transcript
~> splits , lorem,ipsum
▶ lorem
▶ ipsum
~> splits '' 你好
▶ 你
▶ 好
```

**Note**: `splits` does not support splitting by regular expressions,
`$sep` is always interpreted as a plain string. Use
[re:split](re.html#split) if you need to split by regex.

Etymology: Various languages as `split`, in particular
[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.split).

$cf joins


## src

```elvish
src
```

Output a map-like value describing the current source being evaluated. The
value contains the following fields:

*   `type`, which can be one of `interactive`, `script` or `module`;

*   `name`, which is set to the name under which a script is executed or a
    module is imported. It is an empty string when `type` = `interactive`;

*   `path`, which is the path to the current source. It is an empty string
    when `type` = `interactive`;

*   `code`, which is the full body of the current source.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> put (src)[type name path code]
▶ interactive
▶ ''
▶ ''
▶ 'put (src)[type name path code]'
~> echo 'put (src)[type name path code]' > foo.elv
~> elvish foo.elv
▶ script
▶ foo.elv
▶ /home/xiaq/foo.elv
▶ "put (src)[type name path code]\n"
~> echo 'put (src)[type name path code]' > ~/.elvish/lib/m.elv
~> use m
▶ module
▶ m
▶ /home/xiaq/.elvish/lib/m.elv
▶ "put (src)[type name path code]\n"
```

Note: this builtin always returns information of the source of the **calling
function**. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo 'fn f { put (src)[type name path code] }' > ~/.elvish/lib/n.elv
~> use n
~> n:f
▶ module
▶ n
▶ /home/xiaq/.elvish/lib/n.elv
▶ "fn f { put (src)[type name path code] }\n"
```


## styled

```elvish
styled $object $style-transformer...
```

Construct a styled text by applying the supplied transformers to the supplied
object. `$object` can be either a string, a styled segment (see below), a styled
text or an arbitrary concatenation of them. A `$style-transformer` is either:

* The name of a builtin style transformer:

  * On of the attribute names `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underlined`, `blink` or
    `inverse` for setting the corresponding attribute

  * An attribute name prefixed by `no-` for unsetting the attribute

  * An attribute name prefixed by `toggle-` for toggling the attribute between set
    and unset

  * One of the color names `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`,
    `cyan`, `lightgray`, `gray`, `lightred`, `lightgreen`, `lightyellow`,
    `lightblue`, `lightmagenta`, `lightcyan` or `white` for setting the text color

  * A color name prefixed by `bg-` to set the background color

* A lambda that receives a styled segment as the only argument and returns a
  single styled segment

* A function with the same properties as the lambda (provided via the
  `$transformer~` syntax)

When a styled text is converted to a string the corresponding [ANSI SGR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_.28Select_Graphic_Rendition.29_parameters)
is built to render the style.

A styled text is nothing more than a wrapper around a list of styled segments. They
can be accessed by indexing into it.

```elvish
s = (styled abc red)(styled def green)
put $s[0] $s[1]
```


## styled-segment

```elvish
styled-segment $object &fg-color=default &bg-color=default &bold=$false &dim=$false &italic=$false &underlined=$false &blink=$false &inverse=$false
```

Constructs a styled segment and is a helper function for styled transformers.
`$object` can be a plain string, a styled segment or a concatenation thereof.
Probably the only reason to use it is to build custom style transformers:

```elvish
fn my-awesome-style-transformer [seg]{ styled-segment $seg &bold=(not $seg[dim]) &dim=(not $seg[italic]) &italic=$seg[bold] }
styled abc $my-awesome-style-transformer~
```

As just seen the properties of styled segments can be inspected by indexing into it.
Valid indices are the same as the options to `styled-segment` plus `text`.

```elvish
s = (styled-segment abc &bold)
put $s[text]
put $s[fg-color]
put $s[bold]
```


## take

```elvish
take $n $input-list?
```

Retain the first `$n` input elements. If `$n` is larger than the number of
input elements, the entire input is retained. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> take 3 [a b c d e]
▶ a
▶ b
▶ c
~> splits ' ' 'how are you?' | take 1
▶ how
~> range 2 | take 10
▶ 0
▶ 1
```


Etymology: Haskell.


## tilde-abbr

```elvish
tilde-abbr $path
```

If `$path` represents a path under the home directory, replace the
home directory with `~`.  Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo $E:HOME
/Users/foo
~> tilde-abbr /Users/foo
▶ '~'
~> tilde-abbr /Users/foobar
▶ /Users/foobar
~> tilde-abbr /Users/foo/a/b
▶ '~/a/b'
```


## to-json

```elvish
to-json
```

Takes structured stdin, convert it to JSON and puts the result on bytes
stdout.

```elvish-transcript
~> put a | to-json
"a"
~> put [lorem ipsum] | to-json
["lorem","ipsum"]
~> put [&lorem=ipsum] | to-json
{"lorem":"ipsum"}
```

$cf from-json

## to-string

```elvish
to-string $value...
```

Convert arguments to string values.

```elvish-transcript
~> to-string foo [a] [&k=v]
▶ foo
▶ '[a]'
▶ '[&k=v]'
```


## unset-env

```elvish
unset-env $name
```

Unset an environment variable. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> E:X = foo
~> unset-env X
~> has-env X
▶ $false
~> put $E:X
▶ ''
```

$cf has-env get-env set-env


## wcswidth

```elvish
wcswidth $string
```

Output the width of `$string` when displayed on the terminal. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> wcswidth a
▶ 1
~> wcswidth lorem
▶ 5
~> wcswidth 你好，世界
▶ 10
```


## -gc

```elvish
-gc
```

Force the Go garbage collector to run.

This is only useful for debug purposes.


## -ifaddrs

```elvish
-ifaddrs
```

Output all IP addresses of the current host.

This should be part of a networking module instead of the builtin module.

## -log

```elvish
-log $filename
```

Direct internal debug logs to the named file.

This is only useful for debug purposes.


## -stack

```elvish
-stack
```


Print a stack trace.

This is only useful for debug purposes.


## -source

```elvish
-source $filename
```

Read the named file, and evaluate it in the current scope.

Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> cat x.elv
echo 'executing x.elv'
foo = bar
~> -source x.elv
executing x.elv
~> echo $foo
bar
```

Note that while in the example, you can reference `$foo` after sourcing
`x.elv`, putting the `-source` command and reference to `$foo` in the **same
code chunk** (e.g. by using <span class="key">Alt-Enter</span> to insert a
literal Enter, or using `;`) is invalid:

```elvish-transcript
~> # A new Elvish session
~> cat x.elv
echo 'executing x.elv'
foo = bar
~> -source x.elv; echo $foo
Compilation error: variable $foo not found
  [interactive], line 1:
    -source x.elv; echo $foo
```

This is because the reading of the file is done in the evaluation phase, while
the check for variables happens at the compilation phase (before evaluation).
So the compiler has no evidence showing that `$foo` is actually valid, and
will complain. (See [here](../learn/unique-semantics.html#execution-phases) for
a more detailed description of execution phases.)

To work around this, you can add a forward declaration for `$foo`:

```elvish-transcript
~> # Another new session
~> cat x.elv
echo 'executing x.elv'
foo = bar
~> foo = ''; -source x.elv; echo $foo
executing x.elv
bar
```


## -time

```elvish
-time $callable
```

Run the callable, and write the time used to run it. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> -time { sleep 1 }
1.006060647s
```

When the callable also produces outputs, they are a bit tricky to separate
from the output of `-time`. The easiest workaround is to redirect the output
into a temporary file:

```elvish-transcript
~> f = (mktemp)
~> -time { { echo output; sleep 1 } > $f }
1.005589823s
~> cat $f
output
~> rm $f
```


# Builtin Variables

## $_

A blackhole variable.

Values assigned to it will be discarded. Trying to use its value (like `put
$_`) causes an exception.

## $after-chdir

A list of functions to run after changing directory. These functions are
always called with directory to change it, which might be a relative path. The
following example also shows `$before-chdir`:

```elvish-transcript
~> before-chdir = [[dir]{ echo "Going to change to "$dir", pwd is "$pwd }]
~> after-chdir = [[dir]{ echo "Changed to "$dir", pwd is "$pwd }]
~> cd /usr
Going to change to /usr, pwd is /Users/xiaq
Changed to /usr, pwd is /usr
/usr> cd local
Going to change to local, pwd is /usr
Changed to local, pwd is /usr/local
/usr/local>
```

$cf before-chdir

## $args

A list containing command-line arguments. Analogous to `argv` in some other
languages. Examples:

```elvish-transcript
~> echo 'put $args' > args.elv
~> elvish args.elv foo -bar
▶ [foo -bar]
~> elvish -c 'put $args' foo -bar
▶ [foo -bar]
```

As demonstrated above, this variable does not contain the name of the script
used to invoke it. For that information, use the `src` command.

$cf src

## $before-chdir

A list of functions to run before changing directory. These functions are
always called with the new working directory.

$cf after-chdir

## $false

The boolean false value.

## $ok

The special value used by `?()` to signal absence of exceptions.

## $num-bg-jobs

Number of background jobs.

## $notify-bg-job-success

Whether to notify success of background jobs, defaulting to `$true`.

Failures of background jobs are always notified.

## $paths

A list of search paths, kept in sync with `$E:PATH`. It is easier to use than
`$E:PATH`.

## $pid

The process ID of the current Elvish process.

## $pwd

The present working directory. Setting this variable has the same effect as
`cd`. This variable is most useful in temporary assignment.

Example:

```elvish
## Updates all git repositories
for x [*/] {
    pwd=$x {
        if ?(test -d .git) {
            git pull
        }
    }
}
```

Etymology: the `pwd` command.

## $true

The boolean true value.

## $value-out-indicator

A string put before value outputs (such as those of of `put`). Defaults to
`'▶ '`. Example:

```elvish-transcript
~> put lorem ipsum
▶ lorem
▶ ipsum
~> value-out-indicator = 'val> '
~> put lorem ipsum
val> lorem
val> ipsum
```

Note that you almost always want some trailing whitespace for readability.

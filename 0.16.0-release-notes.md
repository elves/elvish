This is the draft release notes for 0.16.0. It is scheduled to be released on
2020-07-01.

# Breaking changes

-   The following commands are now replaced by `edit:close-mode`:
    `edit:close-listing`, `edit:completion:close`, `edit:history:close`,
    `edit:listing:close`.

-   The `edit:histlist:toggle-case-sensitivity` command has been removed.
    Instead, the history listing mode now applies smart-case matching by
    default.

-   The `path:eval-symlinks` command no longer returns an error when the
    argument is an invalid path; instead it now returns the original path.
    ([#1236](https://b.elv.sh/1236)).

# Notable bugfixes

-   The `path:is-dir` and `path:is-regular` commands no longer follow symlinks,
    as advertised in the documentation.

-   Evaluating `~username` no longer appends a slash
    ([#1246](https://b.elv.sh/1246)).

# Notable new features

New features in the interactive editor:

-   The editor now supports setting global bindings via `$edit:global-binding`.
    Global bindings are consulted for keys not present in mode-specific
    bindings.

-   A new `edit:clear` builtin to clear the screen has been added.

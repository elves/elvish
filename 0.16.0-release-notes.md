This is the draft release notes for 0.16.0. It is scheduled to be released on
2020-07-01.

# Breaking changes

-   The `builtin:` namespace, useful for referring to builtin variables and
    commmands explicitly, now requires `use builtin` before use, consistent with
    other standard library modules.

-   As a side effect of support for a integer numbers, contexts that require
    integers no longer accept floating point numbers with a zero fraction part
    (e.g. `$li[1.0]` is now illegal; `$li[1]` is required).

-   The following commands are now replaced by `edit:close-mode`:
    `edit:close-listing`, `edit:completion:close`, `edit:history:close`,
    `edit:listing:close`.

-   The `edit:histlist:toggle-case-sensitivity` command has been removed.
    Instead, the history listing mode now applies smart-case matching by
    default.

# Deprecated features

Deprecated features will be removed in 0.17.0.

The following deprecated features trigger a warning whenever the code is parsed
or compiled, even if it is not executed:

-   The `fopen` and `fclose` commands are deprecated. Use `file:open` and
    `file:close` instead.

# Notable bugfixes

-   The `path:is-dir` and `path:is-regular` commands no longer follow symlinks,
    as advertised in the documentation.

-   Evaluating `~username` no longer appends a slash
    ([#1246](https://b.elv.sh/1246)).

# Notable new features

New features in the language:

-   Elvish's number type has been extended with support for arbitrary-precision
    integers and rationals. Many numerical commands in the builtin module and
    the `math:` module have been extended with support for them.

New features in the standard library:

-   A new `file:` module contains utilities for manipulating files.

-   Commands for creating, what are usually meant to be temporary, unique
    directories, path:temp-dir, and regular files, path:temp-file
    ([#1255](https://b.elv.sh/1255)).

New features in the interactive editor:

-   The editor now supports setting global bindings via `$edit:global-binding`.
    Global bindings are consulted for keys not present in mode-specific
    bindings.

-   A new `edit:clear` builtin to clear the screen has been added.

-   The editor now uses a DSL for filtering items in completion, history
    listing, location and navigation modes.

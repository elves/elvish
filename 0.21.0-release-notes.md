# Notable new features

-   The `os` module has gained the following new commands: `mkdir-all`,
    `symlink` and `rename`.

-   A new `md` module, currently containing a single function `md:show` for
    rendering Markdown in the terminal.

# Notable bugfixes

-   The string comparison commands `<s`, `<=s`, `==s`, `>s` and `>=s` (but not
    `!=s`) now accept any number of arguments, as they are documented to do.

# Deprecations

-   The implicit cd feature is now deprecated. Use `cd` or location mode
    instead.

# Breaking changes

-   Support for the legacy `~/.elvish` directory has been removed.

-   The commands `!=`, `!=s` and `not-eq` now only accepts two arguments
    ([#1767](https://b.elv.sh/1767)).

-   The commands `edit:kill-left-alnum-word` and `edit:kill-right-alnum-word`
    have been renamed to `edit:kill-alnum-word-left` and
    `edit:kill-alnum-word-right`, to be consistent with the documentation and
    the names of other similar commands.

    If you need to write code that supports both names, use `has-key` to detect
    which name is available:

    ```elvish
    fn kill-alnum-word-left {
        if (has-key edit: kill-alnum-word-left~) {
            edit:kill-alnum-word-left
        } else {
            edit:kill-left-alnum-word
        }
    }
    ```

-   Using `else` without `catch` in the `try` special command is no longer
    supported. The command `try { a } else { b } finally { c }` is equivalent to
    just `try { a; b } finally { c }`.

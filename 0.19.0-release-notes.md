This is the draft release notes for 0.19.0, scheduled to be released around
2022-07-01.

# Breaking changes

# Deprecated features

Deprecated features will be removed in 0.20.0.

The following deprecated features trigger a warning whenever the code is parsed
and compiled, even if it is not executed:

-   The `float64` command is now deprecated. Use `num` for constructing a typed
    number, or `inexact-num` for constructing an inexact number.

    The documentation has advertised it as deprecated since the 0.16.0 release,
    but deprecation warnings were never added.

# Notable bugfixes

-   Temporary assignment on an unset environment variables no longer leave it
    set to an empty string ([#1448](https://b.elv.sh/1448)).

# Notable new features

-   A new `inexact-num` converts its argument to an inexact number.

    It is functionally identical to the now deprecated `float64` command since
    the Go float64 type is the only underlying inexact number type for now. Its
    behavior may change in future if there are more underlying types for inexact
    numbers.

-   A new `dedupe` command to eliminate consecutive duplicate values
    ([#1453](https://b.elv.sh/1453)).

-   A new type of interactive abbreviation: `edit:command-abbr`
    ([#1472](https://b.elv.sh/1472)).

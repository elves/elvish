		The terminals sometimes has different opinions about how wide some
		characters are (notably emojis and some dingbats) with elvish. When that
		happens, elvish becomes wrong about where the cursor is when it writes
		its output, and the effect can be disastrous.

		If we turn off autowrap, the terminal won't insert any newlines behind
		the scene, so elvish is always right about which line the cursor is.
		With a bit more caution, this can restrict the consequence of the
		mismatch within one line.

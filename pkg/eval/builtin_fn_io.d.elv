# ▶ a
# ~> put lorem ipsum [a b] { ls }
# ▶ lorem
# ▶ ipsum
# ▶ [a b]
# ▶ <closure 0xc4202607e0>

#
# **Note**: It is almost never necessary to use `put (...)` - just write the

fn put {|@value| }

# Output `$value` for `$n` times. Example:

fn repeat {|n value| }

# Reads byte input until `$terminator` or end-of-file is encountered. It outputs the part of the
# input read as a string value. The output contains the trailing `$terminator`, unless `read-upto`
# terminated at end-of-file.
#
# The `$terminator` must be a single ASCII character such as `"\x00"` (NUL).
#
# Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> echo "a,b,c" | read-upto ","
# ▶ 'a,'
# ~> echo "foo\nbar" | read-upto "\n"
# ▶ "foo\n"
# ~> echo "a.elv\x00b.elv" | read-upto "\x00"
# ▶ "a.elv\x00"
# ~> print "foobar" | read-upto "\n"
# ▶ foobar
# ```
fn read-upto {|terminator| }

# Reads a single line from byte input, and writes the line to the value output,
# stripping the line ending. A line can end with `"\r\n"`, `"\n"`, or end of
# file. Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> print line | read-line
# ▶ line
# ~> print "line\n" | read-line
# ▶ line
# ~> print "line\r\n" | read-line
# ▶ line
# ~> print "line-with-extra-cr\r\r\n" | read-line
# ▶ "line-with-extra-cr\r"
# ```
fn read-line { }

# Like `echo`, just without the newline.

#
# Etymology: Various languages, in particular
# [Perl](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/print.html) and
# [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html), whose
# `print`s do not print a trailing newline.
fn print {|&sep=' ' @value| }

# Prints values to the byte stream according to a template. If you need to inject the output into
# the value stream use this pattern: `printf .... | slurp`. That ensures that any newlines in the
# output of `printf` do not cause its output to be broken into multiple values, thus eliminating
# the newlines, which will occur if you do `put (printf ....)`.
#
# Like [`print`](), this command does not add an implicit newline; include an explicit `"\n"`
# in the formatting template instead. For example, `printf "%.1f\n" (/ 10.0 3)`.
#
# See Go's [`fmt`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#hdr-Printing) package for
# details about the formatting verbs and the various flags that modify the
# default behavior, such as padding and justification.
#
# Unlike Go, each formatting verb has a single associated internal type, and
# accepts any argument that can reasonably be converted to that type:
#
# - The verbs `%s`, `%q` and `%v` convert the corresponding argument to a
#   string in different ways:
#
#     - `%s` uses [to-string](#to-string) to convert a value to string.
#
#     - `%q` uses [repr](#repr) to convert a value to string.
#
#     - `%v` is equivalent to `%s`, and `%#v` is equivalent to `%q`.
#
# - The verb `%t` first convert the corresponding argument to a boolean using
#   [bool](#bool), and then uses its Go counterpart to format the boolean.
#
# - The verbs `%b`, `%c`, `%d`, `%o`, `%O`, `%x`, `%X` and `%U` first convert
#   the corresponding argument to an integer using an internal algorithm, and
#   use their Go counterparts to format the integer.
#
# - The verbs `%e`, `%E`, `%f`, `%F`, `%g` and `%G` first convert the
#   corresponding argument to a floating-point number using
#   [float64](#float64), and then use their Go counterparts to format the
#   number.
#
# The special verb `%%` prints a literal `%` and consumes no argument.
#
# Verbs not documented above are not supported.
#
# Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> printf "%10s %.2f\n" Pi $math:pi
#         Pi 3.14
# ~> printf "%-10s %.2f %s\n" Pi $math:pi $math:pi
# Pi         3.14 3.141592653589793
# ~> printf "%d\n" 0b11100111
# 231
# ~> printf "%08b\n" 231
# 11100111
# ~> printf "list is: %q\n" [foo bar 'foo bar']
# list is: [foo bar 'foo bar']
# ```
#
# **Note**: Compared to the [POSIX `printf`
# command](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xcu/printf.html)
# found in other shells, there are 3 key differences:
#
# - The behavior of the formatting verbs are based on Go's
#   [`fmt`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/) package instead of the POSIX
#   specification.
#
# - The number of arguments after the formatting template must match the number
#   of formatting verbs. The POSIX command will repeat the template string to
#   consume excess values; this command does not have that behavior.
#
# - This command does not interpret escape sequences such as `\n`; just use
#   [double-quoted strings](language.html#double-quoted-string).
#
# See also [`print`](), [`echo`](), [`pprint`](), and [`repr`]().
fn printf {|template @value| }

# Print all arguments, joined by the `sep` option, and followed by a newline.
#
# Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> echo Hello   elvish
# Hello elvish
# ~> echo "Hello   elvish"
# Hello   elvish
# ~> echo &sep=, lorem ipsum
# lorem,ipsum
# ```
#
# Notes: The `echo` builtin does not treat `-e` or `-n` specially. For instance,
# `echo -n` just prints `-n`. Use double-quoted strings to print special
# characters, and `print` to suppress the trailing newline.
#
# See also [`print`]().
#
# Etymology: Bourne sh.
fn echo {|&sep=' ' @value| }

# Pretty-print representations of Elvish values. Examples:

# ~> pprint [&k1=v1 &k2=v2]
# [
# &k2=
# v2
# &k1=
# v1
# ]
# ```
#
# Maps (both mutable and [pseudo](language.html#pseudo-map)) are output with
# their keys sorted in the same order as `keys $map | order &types`.
#
# The output format is subject to change.
#
# See also [`repr`]().
fn pprint {|@value| }

# Writes representation of `$value`s, separated by space and followed by a

fn repr {|@value| }

# Shows the value to the output, which is assumed to be a VT-100-compatible
